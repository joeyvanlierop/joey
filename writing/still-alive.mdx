I am terrible at working on this website.

I want all of my work here to be perfect, but the reality is that it burns me out. Not that I want to publicize my each and every thought, but I think I need to be less critical of my work and use this as a relaxing creative outlet. Move fast and break things (disgusting). I'm going to try working through the things that have piled up over the past year without getting stunlocked.

November TODOs:  
 - [x] Update mood
 - [x] Update job
 - [ ] Update **Today**
 - [ ] Add all the movies I forgor to add
 - [ ] Start working on West Coast Trail
 - [ ] Publish a new writing (maybe a behind the scene of some video, or boardgame writing ala space biff)
 - [ ] Please god get a new favicon

 Ok thanks bye.
