      Well here it is, in all its glory. *The January Journal*. Like I said [a
      couple of days ago](/writing/procrastination), I am definitely, 100%,
      without fail, going to write at least one thing per day. There is no
      chance I get lazy and/or forget. This is going to be a piece of{" "}

      *Blue Eye Samurai* is delightful. I tend to be very nitpicky about the
      shows that I watch, probably unfairly so, but it's been very hard to find
      anything to dislike about *Blue Eye Samurai*. It's clich√©, and yet it
      feels like a fresh of breath air. It reminds me of when I first got hooked
      on *Game Of Thrones*.

      *Godzilla Minus One* was alright. Watching the movie in a theatre
      surrounded by people who were talking unimaginably loudly made me feel
      like a grumpy old man though...

      On the way to Revelstoke right now. Amidst one of the worst snowfalls of
      all time, we may have timed this to perfection. May the{" "}

      The ski gods blessed us today. The rain of Revelstoke turned to snow as we
      rode up the gondola. Fresh pow and good lines greeted us at the top of
      Stoke chair. This was pretty much the best-case scenario for my first day
      skiing this season, although my legs are jello and my back is creaky.
      Tomorrow is going to be fun (read: painful)

      Today was about as painful as I expected, but that's the price we pay for
      pow. So many incredible lines, but run-of-the-day had to be at Greely
      Bowl. Chase and I followed some locals into one of the sketchiest lines on
      the mountain and had to play avoid the cliff the whole way down. 10/10.

      Thank you snow gods for the dirt-nasty pow lines you have bestowed upon
      us. Run-of-the-day was in the out-of-bounds bowl just beside Japapeno that
      some random local guided us to. Apparently, [it used to be a cat-skiing
      spot](https://www.elevationoutdoors.com/snowsports/weekend-trip-sweet-sidecountry-revelstoke-kicking-horse/).
      Whatever it used to be, it was incredible today.

      And just like that, the winter break is over. My resolution for this
      semester is to not completely neglect my writing. Might need to start a
      February Fournal...
