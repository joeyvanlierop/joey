            Well here it is, in all its glory. *The January Journal*.  
            Like I said [a couple of days ago](/writing/procrastination), I am definitely, 100%, without fail, going to write at least one thing per day. There is no chance I get lazy and/or forget. This is going to be a piece of <Nook popup="üç∞">*cake*</Nook>.

            *Blue Eye Samurai* is delightful.  
            I tend to be very nitpicky about the shows that I watch, probably unfairly so, but it's been very hard to find anything to dislike about *Blue Eye Samurai*. It's clich√©, and yet it feels like a fresh of breath air. It reminds me of when I first got hooked on *Game Of Thrones*.

            *Godzilla Minus One* was alright. Watching the movie in a theatre surrounded by people who were talking unimaginably loudly made me feel like a grumpy old man though...

            On the way to Revelstoke right now. Amidst one of the worst snowfalls of all time, we may have timed this to perfection. May the <Nook popup="‚òÉÔ∏è">*snow*</Nook> gods bless us.
