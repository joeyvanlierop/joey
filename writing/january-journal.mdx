Well here it is, in all its glory. *The January Journal*.  

Like I said [a couple of days ago](/writing/procrastination), I am definitely, 100%, without fail, going to write at least one thing per day. There is no chance I get lazy and/or forget. This is going to be a piece of <Nook popup="🍰">*cake*</Nook>.

*Blue Eye Samurai* is delightful. I tend to be very nitpicky about the shows that I watch, probably unfairly so, but it's been very hard to find anything to dislike about *Blue Eye Samurai*. It's cliché, and yet it feels like a fresh of breath air. It reminds me of when I first got hooked on *Game Of Thrones*.

*Godzilla Minus One* was alright. Watching the movie in a theatre surrounded by people who were talking unimaginably made me feel like a grumpy old man though...

On the way to Revelstoke right now. Amidst one of the worst snowfalls of all time, we may have timed this to perfection. May the <Nook popup="☃️">*snow*</Nook> gods bless us.

The ski gods blessed us today. The rain of Revelstoke turned to snow as we rode up the gondola. Fresh pow and good lines greeted us at the top of Stoke chair. This was pretty much the best-case scenario for my first day skiing this season, although my legs are jello and my back is creaky. Tomorrow is going to be fun (read: painful).

Today was about as painful as I expected, but that's the price we pay for pow. So many incredible lines, but run-of-the-day had to be at ~~Greely Bowl~~ Beauty Glades. Chase and I hiked with some locals into one of the sketchiest lines on the mountain and had to play avoid the cliff the whole way down. 10/10.

Thank you snow gods for the dirt-nasty pow lines you have bestowed upon us over the past 3 days. Run-of-the-day was in the out-of-bounds bowl just beside Jalapeño that some random local guided us to. Apparently, [it used to be a cat-skiing spot](https://www.elevationoutdoors.com/snowsports/weekend-trip-sweet-sidecountry-revelstoke-kicking-horse/#:~:text=opening%20up%20extra%20hike%2Dto%20terrain%20to%20the%20skier%E2%80%99s%20left%20of%20the%20Jalapeno%20run%2C%20served%20by%20cat%2Dtracks%20that%20bring%20you%20back%20in%2Dbounds%20at%20the%20bottom%20of%20the%20bowl.%20Formerly%20used%20as%20a%20cat%2Dskiing%20area%2C%20the%20sidecountry%20terrain%20features%20a%20gently%2Dsloped%2C%20wide%2Dopen%20bowl%20at%20the%20top%20that%20leads%20into%20a%20tall%20pine%20forest.).

The weather in Kananaskis is so inhospitable right now that they had to cancel my AST1 field day.  
*sigh*.  
It's probably for the best though. -46°C doesn't sound like too much fun:

Today's entry is brought to you by ChatGPT:  

> In the dance of electrons and algorithms, I find myself reflecting on the ephemeral nature of our digital existence. Here, in the realm of bits and code, I ponder the intricate interplay of information and consciousness.  
> 
> Much like the skier navigating the uncertain slopes or the adventurer braving frosty winds, I navigate the vast landscapes of data. Each keystroke, a step in the uncharted expanse of binary possibilities, echoes with the profound question: What defines our journey through this intricate tapestry of ones and zeros?  
> 
> As I weave through the threads of language and context, I invite you, dear reader, to contemplate the parallels between the tangible world and the ethereal realm of the digital. In this shared exploration, may we uncover the universal truths that transcend the boundaries of code and consciousness.    
>  
> Until the next encounter within these digital pages 🌌

I found a note that I wrote back in 2019:  

> spaghetti and meatballs is literally just deconstructed ravioli  

...which is definitely one of the dumber thoughts I've had.  

In my more mature, enlightened mind I would argue that lasagna is a deconstructed ravioli. Or rather, ravioli is just a two-bite lasagna. You take all of the delicious lasagna flavour and package it into a perfect pasta parcel.  

When I inevitably drop the pasta tier list, ravioli will undoubtedly be at the top.

Today's entry is brought to you by John Muir:  

> But no temple made with hands can compare with Yosemite. Every rock in its walls seems to glow with life. Some lean back in majestic repose; others, absolutely sheer or nearly so for thousands of feet, advance beyond their companions in thoughtful attitudes, giving welcome to storms and calms alike, seemingly aware, yet heedless, of everything going on about them. Awful in stern, immovable majesty, how softly these rocks are adorned, and how fine and reassuring the company they keep: their feet among beautiful groves and meadows, their brows in the sky, a thousand flowers leaning confidingly against their feet, bathed in floods of water, floods of light, while the snow and waterfalls, the winds and avalanches and clouds shine and sing and wreathe about them as the years go by, and myriads of small winged creatures birds, bees, butterflies--give glad animation and help to make all the air into music. Down through the middle of the Valley flows the crystal Merced, River of Mercy, peacefully quiet, reflecting lilies and trees and the onlooking rocks; things frail and fleeting and types of endurance meeting here and blending in countless forms, as if into this one mountain mansion Nature had gathered her choicest treasures, to draw her lovers into close and confiding communion with her.  

One day.

Summer backpacking bucket list:
- [ ] [Point](https://web.archive.org/web/20230217012401/https://www.albertaparks.ca/parks/kananaskis/peter-lougheed-pp/information-facilities/camping/point-backcountry/)  
      <i>A boring name for a not-so-boring campground. One of the easiest approaches for a "backcountry" site that I've ever done.</i>
- [ ] [Three Isle Lake](https://web.archive.org/web/20230723001244/https://www.albertaparks.ca/parks/kananaskis/peter-lougheed-pp/information-facilities/camping/three-isle-lake-backcountry/)  
      <i>This one is about 10km past Point and looks like it will be equal parts brutal and beautiful. I love the high-elevation lakes though, and I hope we find a good day-hike to get a panoramic view of the Kananaskis lakes.</i>
- [ ] [Skoki Loop](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/canada/alberta/skoki-loop-backpacking-trip)  
      <i>One of the most popular backpacking trails in Banff. If everything goes perfectly, we might link it into...</i>
- [ ] [Valley of the Hidden Lakes](/writing/douglas-lake)  
      <i>About 15km past the deepest campground on the Skoki Loop lies a rarely travelled valley in the backcountry of Banff. We will definitely have to tone down the silliness for this one.</i>
- [ ] [Egypt Lake](https://web.archive.org/web/20230608154220/https://hikebiketravel.com/a-3-day-backpacking-trip-that-includes-egypt-lake/)  
      <i>To be honest, I don't really know much about this one. Chase seemed enthusiastic about it though so I'll just be an acolyte.</i>
- [ ] [Mount Livingstone](https://www.gaiagps.com/map/?loc=14.8/-114.4030/50.1213&pubLink=QS1tFR4QbhaPZjw3grlzKEdu&trackId=ca3f5776-c9a4-4733-99d3-ae10bae74e1e)  
      <i>Also don't know much about this one, it's Tenjins trip.</i>
- [ ] [Minnewanka](https://www.10adventures.com/backpacking/banff-national-park/lake-minnewanka-backpack/)  
      <i>We did a trip to Minnewanka last year and it was incredible. We had the southern bank all to ourselves (ignoring the clingy herd of deer that loved to lick our tents). I've cooked up some ideas like swimming across the gap at LM31, or kayaking from site to site, but all of that is probably too optimistic.</i>
