      Well here it is, in all its glory. *The January Journal*.  
      Like I said [a couple of days ago](/writing/procrastination), I am definitely, 100%, without fail, going to write at least one thing per day. There is no chance I get lazy and/or forget. This is going to be a piece of <Nook popup="🍰">*cake*</Nook>.

      *Blue Eye Samurai* is delightful. I tend to be very nitpicky about the shows that I watch, probably unfairly so, but it's been very hard to find anything to dislike about *Blue Eye Samurai*. It's cliché, and yet it feels like a fresh of breath air. It reminds me of when I first got hooked on *Game Of Thrones*.

      *Godzilla Minus One* was alright. Watching the movie in a theatre surrounded by people who were talking unimaginably made me feel like a grumpy old man though...

      On the way to Revelstoke right now. Amidst one of the worst snowfalls of all time, we may have timed this to perfection. May the <Nook popup="☃️">*snow*</Nook> gods bless us.

      The ski gods blessed us today. The rain of Revelstoke turned to snow as we rode up the gondola. Fresh pow and good lines greeted us at the top of Stoke chair. This was pretty much the best-case scenario for my first day skiing this season, although my legs are jello and my back is creaky. Tomorrow is going to be fun (read: painful).

      Today was about as painful as I expected, but that's the price we pay for pow. So many incredible lines, but run-of-the-day had to be at Greely Bowl. Chase and I hiked with some locals into one of the sketchiest lines on the mountain and had to play avoid the cliff the whole way down. 10/10.

      Thank you snow gods for the dirt-nasty pow lines you have bestowed upon us over the past 3 days. Run-of-the-day was in the out-of-bounds bowl just beside Jalapeño that some random local guided us to. Apparently, [it used to be a cat-skiing spot](https://www.elevationoutdoors.com/snowsports/weekend-trip-sweet-sidecountry-revelstoke-kicking-horse/#:~:text=opening%20up%20extra%20hike%2Dto%20terrain%20to%20the%20skier%E2%80%99s%20left%20of%20the%20Jalapeno%20run%2C%20served%20by%20cat%2Dtracks%20that%20bring%20you%20back%20in%2Dbounds%20at%20the%20bottom%20of%20the%20bowl.%20Formerly%20used%20as%20a%20cat%2Dskiing%20area%2C%20the%20sidecountry%20terrain%20features%20a%20gently%2Dsloped%2C%20wide%2Dopen%20bowl%20at%20the%20top%20that%20leads%20into%20a%20tall%20pine%20forest.).  
      Whatever it used to be, it was incredible today.

      And just like that, the winter break is over. My resolution for this semester is to not completely neglect my writing. Might need to start a February Fournal...

      "Whumph" might be my new favorite onomatopoeia, although I hope I never get to hear it in-person. Such a silly word for a very non-silly thing...
