            Well here it is, in all its glory. *The January Journal*.  
            Like I said [a couple of days ago](/writing/procrastination), I am definitely, 100%, without fail, going to write at least one thing per day. There is no chance I get lazy and/or forget. This is going to be a piece of <Nook popup="üç∞">*cake*</Nook>.

            *Blue Eye Samurai* is magnificent.  
            I tend to be very nitpicky about the shows that I watch, sometimes unfairly so, but it's been very hard to find anything to dislike about *Blue Eye Samurai* so far. Sometimes it feels clich√©, and yet by the end of every episode, I am completely engrossed. It reminds me of a faster-paced *Game Of Thrones* in a very unexpected way...
