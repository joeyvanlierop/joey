"What was your favourite part?"

It's the inevitable question. But the answer isn't very exciting: "Owen's Point"

It's impossible to convey everything that this trip meant to me in one laconic reply, so the answer is a little lackluster. I'm not eloquent enough to set the scene and recount the journey in a sentence or two. All of the highs and lows, the struggles and the rewards, The people I met along the way, and the person that I have become. What the West Coast Trail truly meant to me. Instead, I'm going to have to write a thesis paper on it and bore you to death.
