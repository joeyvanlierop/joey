- The final act sections the table into teams: A/B fates vs C fates
    - Regents and outlaws alike must keep the C fates in check
- Conspirator with dealmakers is busted
- We should have declared ambitions way way way way way more quickly
- Why did I let maguire plunder all my shit?
- Should have teamed up with Max and decimated the C fates
- A/B fates are like the chancellor in Oath: they only win if they weather the storm
