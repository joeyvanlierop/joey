I bought a little Olympus XA2 film camera to experiment with film photography during the winter. Here are all of the the best (and worst) 35mm shots I took.

  caption="Always nice to start with a blurry indoor shot. This was the boys when we arrived in Revelstoke for our first ski trip. Cool to see the film burn though."

  caption="First outdoor shot! Not a very interesting photo, but that run through North Bowl was rad."

  width={3000}
  height={2000}
  className="rounded-md"
  caption="Looking back up at a run that Chase and I went on together. We had to hike, wait in a line, commit to a sketchy drop in front of 20 people, and get chirped at by some locals just to get into Greely Bowl. "

  width={3000}
  height={2000}
  className="rounded-md"
  caption="...and it didn't end there. We had to do another brutal hike straight up a hill to get to the good stuff. Chase was slightly relieved when we finally got to the top."

  src={"/images/a-roll-of-winter/6.webp"}
  width={3000}
  height={2000}
  className="rounded-md"
  caption="We would always start our Revelstoke days with a couple warmup laps in Tally-Ho glades. This (blurry) shot was the setup for some action shots in the trees."

  caption="A bit later in the trip, we had an unbelivable pow day. This was a view of some cliffs I dropped. Just after I took this shot, Marc hit a huge cliff, landed, caught his tips, front flipped, and skied it out. Pretty rad."

  width={3000}
  height={2000}
  className="rounded-md"

Unfortunately they had mostly moved on, but you can still see some of the clouds blanketed on top of the Tetons."
