<Nook popup="March 9th, 2024">*Kung Fu Panda 4*</Nook>, 5/10   
    They banished this series to the spirit realm.

<Nook popup="March 8th, 2024">*Children of Men*</Nook>, 9/10   
    1 hour and 42 minutes of relentless despair, albeit quite beautiful despair. There were so many incredible long takes, but my favorite one had to be the one in the Bexhill camp. My eyes got pretty sweaty during that scene. Watching this made me want to rewatch *The Leftovers*, although my tolerance for depressing media is pretty cooked right now.

<Nook popup="March 2nd, 2024">*Dune: Part Two*</Nook>, 7/10  
    I still think that the first half of *Dune: Part One* was the most interesting portion between both of the movies, but I enjoyed this one was better as a whole. The pacing in the first was a little too slow, and this one went the opposite way and was a little too spicy. No idea how they are gonna do Messiah though...
