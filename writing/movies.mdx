<Nook popup="October 31st, 2023">*The Shining*</Nook>, 10/10  
    Best spooky movie

<Nook popup="March 17th, 2024">*Poor Things*</Nook>, 8/10   
    Absurd in a great way. Completely cinematically unique. An amazingly weird score. There's really nothing quite like it. 

<Nook popup="March 173th, 2024">*Finding Nemo*</Nook>, 7/10   
    Touch the butt. 

<Nook popup="March 9th, 2024">*Men in Black*</Nook>, 7/10   
    Amazing performance by Jaden Smith's dad.

<Nook popup="March 9th, 2024">*Kung Fu Panda 4*</Nook>, 4/10   
    They banished this series to the spirit realm.

<Nook popup="March 8th, 2024">*Children of Men*</Nook>, 9/10   
    1 hour and 42 minutes of relentless despair, albeit quite beautiful despair. There were so many incredible long takes, but my favorite one had to be the one in the Bexhill camp. My eyes got pretty sweaty during that scene. Watching this made me want to rewatch *The Leftovers*, although my tolerance for depressing media is pretty cooked right now.

<Nook popup="March 2nd, 2024">*Dune: Part Two*</Nook>, 7/10  
    I still think that the first half of *Dune: Part One* was the most interesting portion between both of the movies, but I enjoyed this one more as a whole. The pacing in the first was a little too slow, and this one went the opposite way and was a little too spicy. No idea how they are gonna do Messiah though...  

<Nook popup="May 1st, 2024">*Challengers*</Nook>, 10/10  
    God damn this was good. 

<Nook popup="May 3rd, 2024">*Civil War*</Nook>, 5/10  
    God damn this was mid.

<Nook popup="May 11th, 2024">*The Fall Guy*</Nook>, 6/10  
    I will always love Ryan Gosling, but this one dragged on a little too long. 

<Nook popup="May 25th, 2024">*Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga*</Nook>, 8/10  
    What an incredible prosthetic nose. 

<Nook popup="August 7th, 2024">*Deadpool & Wolverine*</Nook>, 6/10  
    I loved the trashy humor, but around halfway it starts to take itself a little too seriously. They just need a sillier plot next time.

<Nook popup="September 1st, 2024">*Alien: Romulus*</Nook>, 9/10  
    Alien with a hint of Blade Runner and a healthy dose of 2001: A Space Odyssey

<Nook popup="September 2st, 2024">*Gladiator*</Nook>, 6/10  
    I was not entertained

<Nook popup="September 26st, 2024">*The Godfather*</Nook>, 9/10  
    I was entertained

<Nook popup="October 31st, 2024">*The Thing*</Nook>, 6/10  
    The first amogus-type movie

<Nook popup="November 2nd, 2024">*The Wild Robot*</Nook>, 7/10  
    Much better than I expected, shouldn't have been a hater

<Nook popup="January 3rd, 2025">*Nosferatu*</Nook>, 7/10  
    It was very beautiful. The first half was great, but I didn't love the other half.

<Nook popup="January 29th, 2025">*Wicked*</Nook>, 7/10  
    Better than I expected, no longer a certified hater

<Nook popup="March 15rd, 2025">*Mickey 17*</Nook>, 7/10  
    Pretty good, but a little too much.

<Nook popup="May 28th, 2025">*Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning*</Nook>, 6/10  
    Fine. Overstayed its welcome, but still a fun action flick.

<Nook popup="June 1st, 2025">*Little Miss Sunshine*</Nook>, 9/10  
    Excellent. Very thought provoking. Very emotional. Incredible performances. Deserves a rewatch.

<Nook popup="July 26th, 2025">*Fantastic Four: The First Steps*</Nook>, 6/10  
    Came in with very high expectations from all the glowing reviews. Left feeling a little underwhelmed. Not very impactful or thoughtful, but also not trash.

<Nook popup="September 18th, 2025">*Superman*</Nook>, 5/10  
    Also came in with very high expectations. Also left feeling underwhelmed. This one was trash though.

<Nook popup="August 3rd, 2025">*The Naked Gun (2025)*</Nook>, 7/10  
    Hood classic.

<Nook popup="August 2nd, 2025">*The Naked Gun (1988)*</Nook>, 7/10  
    Somehow a good remake, very pleasantly surprised. Never experienced so much communal laughter in a theatre.

<Nook popup="October 4th, 2025">*One Battle After Another*</Nook>, 8/10  
    Pretty good. Very well shot, very good characters. Deserves a rewatch, also need to watch more Paul Thomas Anderson.

<Nook popup="October 31st, 2025">*Ghostbusters*</Nook>, 5/10  
    This might be one of my worst takes, but I thought this movie was pretty bland. Without any nostalgia, I didn't connect with this movie on any level.

<Nook popup="November 8th, 2025">*Gone Girl*</Nook>, 8/10  
    Very good. Everyone sucks in a very compelling way. Deserves a rewatch.

<Nook popup="November 15th, 2025">*The Running Man*</Nook>, 6/10  
    A little too on the nose, and the ending was bleh.
