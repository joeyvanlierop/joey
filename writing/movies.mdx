<Nook popup="March 17th, 2024">*Poor Things*</Nook>, 8/10   
    Absurd in a great way. Completely cinematically unique. An amazingly weird score. There's really nothing quite like it. 

<Nook popup="March 173th, 2024">*Finding Nemo*</Nook>, 7/10   
    Touch the butt. 

<Nook popup="March 9th, 2024">*Men in Black*</Nook>, 7/10   
    Amazing performance by Jaden Smith's dad.

<Nook popup="March 9th, 2024">*Kung Fu Panda 4*</Nook>, 4/10   
    They banished this series to the spirit realm.

<Nook popup="March 8th, 2024">*Children of Men*</Nook>, 9/10   
    1 hour and 42 minutes of relentless despair, albeit quite beautiful despair. There were so many incredible long takes, but my favorite one had to be the one in the Bexhill camp. My eyes got pretty sweaty during that scene. Watching this made me want to rewatch *The Leftovers*, although my tolerance for depressing media is pretty cooked right now.

<Nook popup="March 2nd, 2024">*Dune: Part Two*</Nook>, 7/10  
    I still think that the first half of *Dune: Part One* was the most interesting portion between both of the movies, but I enjoyed this one more as a whole. The pacing in the first was a little too slow, and this one went the opposite way and was a little too spicy. No idea how they are gonna do Messiah though...  

<Nook popup="May 1st, 2024">*Challengers*</Nook>, 10/10  
    God damn this was good. 

<Nook popup="May 3rd, 2024">*Civil War*</Nook>, 5/10  
    God damn this was mid.

<Nook popup="May 11th, 2024">*The Fall Guy*</Nook>, 6/10  
    I will always love Ryan Gosling, but this one dragged on a little too long. 

<Nook popup="May 11th, 2024">*Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga*</Nook>, 8/10  
    What an incredible prosthetic nose.
