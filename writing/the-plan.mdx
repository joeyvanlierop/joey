## I am exceptionally good at getting in way over my head.

Earlier this year, I was talking to Tenjin about backpacking. He showed me some photos, and my interest was piqued. Traveling to the middle of nowhere, with nothing but what you can carry on your back? As a computer scientist who spends far too much time in front of computers, I felt like I was up for the job. Not only did I feel like I was up for the job, but I confidently stated that I wanted to hike the West Coast Trail. A trail that is notorious for its beauty, tragedy, and unrelenting challenge.

I wasn't quite sure why I was so confident, but nonetheless, I started getting ready for a season of backpacking. Tenjin took Chase and me on our first practice trip into the Crownlands of Alberta. I wisely started packing all of 30 minutes before I left. Needless to say, I forgot pretty much everything except for my tent. Thankfully I survived, and we managed to have lots of fun (and I got to shoot a gun).

But the next trip was better. I got a bigger pack, an actual water filter, a smaller sleeping pad, and just generally was less of a dumbass. I even brought extra batteries which came in clutch! Nevertheless, I still forgot some gear, which has turned out to be the motif for all of my backpacking trips this year. This isn't a huge deal on the 1-night trips we have been doing, but the West Coast Trail is a week of remote hiking through rivers, forests, ladders (oh god so many ladders), surge channels, and pretty much every other hazard imaginable.

And now our West Coast Trail reservation is looming with a sense of impending doom. I might be embellishing a little, but we leave in 2 days and I still have to put together all of my food. I hope it will all go well, but if I'm being honest, it's probably going to be a bit of a shit show. All of the backpacking trips this year have been a bit of a shit show. But what I have learned is that shit shows can be a lot of fun, and that is really what I am hoping for. A shit show full of trials and tribulations, and memories that I will look back on fondly.

## The plan

Tenjin and I start the trail on August 22nd. We have a little bit of a road trip to get over there though, and I am hoping my dinky little car doesn't shit the bed on the 1000km drive over, and that we don't miss the ferry, and that we don't miss the shuttle bus, and that we don't forget any gear. I might be a tiny bit stressed.

We are doing the trail from North to South, which seems to start with the relaxing sections and end with the ankle-shattering, heart-breaking, soul-crushing sections. My (very) tentative plan for campsites is:

1. Pachena Bay to Darling River\
   Should be a nice easy first day to get acclimatized

2. Darling River to Tsusiat Falls\
   Lots of people say Tsusiat Falls is the best campsite on the trail, so definitely looking forward to this

3. Tsusiat Falls to Carmanah Creek\
   This is going to be a long, arduous section. We can bail a little early and camp at Cribs Creek, but [this person](https://hikewct.com/index.php/campsites) really recommends doing the extra 4km to Carmanah Creek

4. Carmanah Creek to Walbran Creek\
   That same person says that this site is super underappreciated, so we will try to do the extra 5km past Bonilla Creek to Walbran Creek

5. Walbran Creek to Cullite Cove\
   Really short and tricky section, but supposedly it is as challenging as it is beautiful

6. Cullite Cove to Thrasher Cove\
   Another short and tricky section through lots of forested areas

7. Thrasher Cove to Gordon River\
   El fin

Then we have to hope that my dinky little car doesn't shit the bed on the 1000km drive back, and that we don't miss the ferry, and that we don't miss the shuttle bus, and that we don't forget any gear. I would be shocked if nothing goes wrong.

{/* ## My pack */}

{/* I promise I'm not a huge weight weenie, but I tried to keep my pack somewhat light. This isn't the perfect packing list, but for the last few trips, I have been really happy with it. My main concern right now is that it hasn't ever been tested in the rain. If I fucked up the seam sealing on the tent, or my rain jacket turns out to be useless, I'm getting wet. */}

## _Editors Note_

_This is pretty much all I wrote before I went into full packing mode. There was way more that I wanted to write, but it turns out that leaving everything to the last minute isn't a great strategy. If you came here looking for beta on the West Coast Trail, take a look at these:_
