Well here it is, in all its glory. *The January Journal*. **TWO**.  

Last year I wrote the [January Journal](/writing/january-journal). Looking back on it gives me a deep sense of cringe, but also a bit of nostalgia. I think that most of the fulfillment I find in writing has to do with giving myself a chance to reminisce about what life was like when I wrote it. Any amount of cringe is worth it for that opportunity.

So technically it's 12:05am on January 3rd, but we're just going to ignore that. Today was a busy day cross-country skiing, ski tuning, and playing boardgames. Cross-country skiing was cold. Ski tuning was suspicious. Boardgames were fun. Ra is definitely S-tier.
