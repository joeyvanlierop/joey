Well here it is, in all its glory. *The January Journal*. **TWO**.  

Last year I wrote the [January Journal](/writing/january-journal). Looking back on it gives me a deep sense of cringe, but also a bit of nostalgia. I think that most of the fulfillment I find in writing has to do with giving myself a chance to reminisce about what life was like when I wrote it. Any amount of cringe is worth it for that opportunity.

So technically it's 12:05am on January 3rd, but we're just going to ignore that. Today was a busy day cross-country skiing, ski tuning, and playing boardgames. Cross-country skiing was cold. Ski tuning was suspicious. Boardgames were fun. Ra is definitely S-tier.

So technically it's 11:06am on January 4th, but we're just going to ignore that. Skiied with Max, Cole, and Dave at Lake Louise today. Farmed some excellent freshies in boundary bowl. Saw Nosferatu and it was beautiful. The first half was great, but I didn't love the other half. Time to get up early tomorrow and get my first tour in.

Finally submitted a [MIN report](https://avalanche.ca/map?panel=mountain-information-network-submissions%2F445089b0-cb2a-11ef-b55b-0a58a9feac02). Many people are calling me a hero, but I am far too humble to accept that title.

Cole, Leah, Faline, and I skinned up Bath Exit Valley ("Thick Shit" to be more specific) to the east-facing alpine fans of Paget Peak.

We dug a very unscientific pit at 2200m and noticed ~10cm of light, fluffy snow sitting on top of a persistent slab ~100cm deep. At the very bottom was ~10cm of faceted snow. We did a column test and noticed a fracture between the surface snow and persistent slab after the 4th shoulder tap which propagated across the entire column.

We followed Trucker's Drainage for most of the descent and it was "covered". Didn't hit any rocks but it was definitely a backseat adventure. There were lots of fallen trees which made some sections spicy. Ended up bailing skiers right around 1600m for a couple of decent turns.

Finally had a relaxing day. Clombed, went to the mall, and took a mega nap with Claire. Still exhausted though...
