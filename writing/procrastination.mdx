My god am I good at procrastinating. It honestly might be my specialty.

I started writing a post about procrastination 2 years ago, and never finished it ([not a joke](https://github.com/joeyvanlierop/joey/blob/e8fefa3725492305f51dd0e7c8fe52d81f3d8c92/posts/humans.mdx)). The first post I ever wrote on here is hidden because I could never bring myself to finish it, and so it will forever lay lurking in the sitemap ([and here](https://joeyvanlierop.com/writing/hello-world)). 

I wish I was better at writing. Every time I come to write something on here, I feel overwhelmed. I started this "blog" 4 years ago, and I still haven't written anything of value. It sucks, and I am worried that I am going to look back when I am older and regret that I never finished my writing projects.

In an effort to be less of a loaf, I am committing the first month of 2024 to be the "write something every single day" month.

No matter what, I vow that I will write something every single day.

I imagine that I will write some very pointless things, but maybe it will stoke the flames. Maybe one day I will actually finish writing about Europe or The West Coast Trail. I just need to stop being so darn lazy! Let's hope my reflection in one orbit is more positive ðŸ˜Š
