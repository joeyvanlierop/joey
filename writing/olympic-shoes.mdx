## Interesting Notes

1. Tomoa Narasaki and Yannick Flohe both used Flagship Pros for Boulder and switched to TN Pros for Lead. Tomoa also used the TN Pros for B4 during the semi-finals which he topped while Yannick couldn't even get the zone. Shoe diff.  
2. Adam Ondra brought in a mountain of shoes, but mostly used Solutions Comps. The only time he switched to Ondra Pros was for B4 during the semi-finals.
It's interesting to see a shoe change from multiple athletes for the same boulder. It was the most slabby boulder so Ondra and Tomoa switched to their most smeary shoes, and both were able to top it.  
3. Jesse Gruper and Brooke Raboutou both used Skwamas for Boulder and switched to Solutions for Lead. I assume they train together, so that might explain it. 
4. Chae-hyun Seo used Theorys for Boulder, and Solution Comps for Lead. I wonder if Jain Kim does something similar... 
5. Miho Nonaka used a [customized Five Ten Aleon with a double strap](https://www.mountainproject.com/forum/topic/122473781/new-510-shoe-spotted-at-world-cup) 
6. Janja Garnbret used a [customized Five Ten Hiangle](https://news.adidas.com/outdoor/adidas-five-ten-i-terrex-athlete-janja-garnbret-has-won-olympic-gold-and-earned-a-spot-among-the-cli/s/58af8203-6cd7-460a-a117-505a688bf60d#:~:text=In%20competitions%2C%20she%20wears%20a%20customized%20Five%20Ten%20Hiangle)
