Today is February 18th, a long awaited date for 7 of my friends and me. By some miracle, we actually managed to successfully (well, hopefully successfully) plan a ski trip together to Nelson during the reading week.

The last hill I went to along the powder highway was Revelstoke, and that was an unforgettable experience so my expectations are perhaps a little bit too high. At the end of the day, some skiing is better than no skiing so I am sure I'll love it regardless. Hopefully I dont jinx anthing, but the snow in the interior has been looking pretty good so it should be nice and shreddable (and about 1 billion times more shreddable than Louise and Sunshine _\*shakes fist in the general direction of global warming\*_).
