#### I am really good at getting in way over my head.

Earlier this year, I was talking to Tenjin about backpacking. He showed me some photos, and my interest was piqued. Traveling to the middle of nowhere, with nothing but what you can carry on your back? As a computer scientist who spends far too much time in front of computers, I felt like I was up for the job. Not only did I feel like I was up for the job, but I confidently stated that I wanted to hike the West Coast Trail. A trail that is notorious for its beauty, tragedy, and unrelenting challenge.

I wasn't quite sure why I was so confident, but nonetheless, I started getting ready for a season of backpacking. Tenjin took Chase and me on our first practice trip in the Crownlands of Alberta. I wisely started packing all of 30 minutes before I left. Needless to say, I forgot pretty much everything except for my tent. We did find some cool bones though (and I got to shoot a gun).

But the next trip was better. I got a bigger pack, an actual water filter, a smaller sleeping pad, and just generally was less of a dumbass. I even brought extra batteries which I had to use! Nevertheless, I still forgot some gear, which has turned out to be the motif for all of my backpacking trips this year. This isn't a huge deal on the 1-night trips we have been doing, but the West Coast Trail is a week of remote hiking through rivers, forests, ladders (oh god so many ladders), and pretty much every other hazard imaginable.

And now our West Coast Trail reservation is looming with a sense of impending doom. I might be embellishing a little, but we leave in 2 days and I still have to put together all of my food. I hope it will all go well, but if I'm being honest, it's probably going to be a bit of a shit show. All of the backpacking trips this year have been a bit of a shit show. But what I have learned is that shit shows can be a lot of fun, and that is really what I am hoping for. A shit show full of trials and tribulations, and a set of memories that I will look back on fondly.

#### The plan

Tenjin and I start the trail on August 22nd. We have a little bit of a road trip to get over there though, and I am hoping my dinky little car doesn't shit the bed on the 1000km drive over, and that we don't miss the ferry, and that we don't miss the shuttle bus, and that we don't forget any gear. I might be a tiny bit stressed.

We are doing the trail from North to South, which seems to start with the relaxing sections and end with the ankle-shattering, heart-breaking, soul-crushing sections. My (very) tentative plan for campsites is:

1. Pachena Bay to Darling River

   Should be a nice easy first day to get acclimatized

2. Darling River to Tsusiat Falls

   Lots of people say Tsusiat Falls is the best campsite on the trail, so definitely looking forwards to this

3. Tsusiat Falls to Carmanah Creek

   This is going to be a long, arduous section. We can bail a little early and camp at Cribs Creek, but [this person](https://hikewct.com/index.php/campsites) really recommends doing the extra 4km to Carmanah Creek

4. Carmanah Creek to Walbran Creek

   That same person says that this site is super underappreciated, so we will try to do the extra 5km past Bonilla Creek to Walbran Creek

5. Walbran Creek to Cullite Cove

   Really short and tricky section, but apparently it is as challenging as it is beautiful

6. Cullite Cove to Thrasher Cove

   Another short and tricky section through lots of forested areas

7. Thrasher Cove to Gordon River

#### My pack

I'm not a huge weight weenie, but I tried to keep it relatively light. I don't claim that this is the perfect packing list, but for the last few trips, I have been really happy with it. My main concern right now is that it hasn't ever been tested in the rain. If I fucked up the seam sealing on the tent, or my rain jacket turns out to be useless, this might be a bit less than ideal.

### Notes for future me

The whole reservation system is a mess. To be fair, part of the difficulty was that I hadn't ever used it, but it would have been useful to have a bit of a hand. Here is the process:

You wait for the countdown to end, and then you get randomly assigned into a queue

Once you have made it through the queue, you need to go to the **Backcountry** tab and select the **West Coast Trail** option

A map will pop up, and you will have to click the **West Coast Trail** button in the bottom right

Now you get to play the fun game of "what dates are available". I was one of the first people to make it through the queue, and yet by the time I have figured out how to use the reservation system, almost all of the dates were taken.

The calendar widget was created by an unpaid intern 2 days before they quit, so I wish you the best of luck trying to figure it out when thousands of other people are making their reservations

That's the gist of it. It is finicky and frustrating, but maybe that adds to the grand allure of the West Coast Trail... _who am I kidding, it totally sucks_

#### Shuttle

We wanted to park our car at the end of the trail so that we could pack up and drive away when we finished. For us, this meant that we have to park at the South access point, and somehow get up to the North access point. There is a shuttle bus called the [West Coast Trail Express](https://trailbus.com/) that does this, but the timings demand a little consideration. The bus only goes North once per day, so we have decided to park the car the night before we start, camp out at Pacheedaht Campground, and take the bus up North in the morning when start. If we miss the bus, we are pretty screwed.
