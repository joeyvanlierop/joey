Oh hi.

I'm not sure what this is going to be quite yet.

I've spent way too long trying to come up with a website design that I like, but I'm realizing that I will never be perfectly content with whatever I concoct. Ultimately I want a place for me to write down my thoughts, mainly for myself, but also for the stray travelers who are graced by Google's SEO.

My goal right now is to write about:

- [ ] Saving my plant
- [ ] Skiing in Nelson
- [ ] Traveling around Europe

Beyond that, I have no clue what I'll put on here. Maybe some movie reviews where I get to say words like _mise-en-sc√®ne_ to sound really pretentious. I also have some ideas about doing a post-mortem on my university classes, namely "The Music of Led Zeppelin" and "Compiler Construction", but I may be too burnt out once the semester is over.

<sup>ok thats everything bye</sup>
