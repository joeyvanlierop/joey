Meet Robert, my beautiful orchid:

Robert lives a good life. He gets to play chess, hang out with his buddies, and bask in the sun:

...or at least he used to. Nowadays he is looking a little worse for wear:

Due to my utter lack of plant knowledge and inability to heed my girlfriend's advice, Robert is now on the brink of death. I'm not quite ready to give up on him yet, so I thought I have been doing my very best (which is pretty bad) to assess his current situation. From what I can tell, I have made 3 mistakes:

1. **I watered him from above**  
   Apparently this can damage the leaves and can also lead to mold, rot, and infections. I have noticed some suspicious-looking spots.

  <Stack
    images={[
      {
        src: "/images/robert-roots-1.jpg",
        alt: "robert root rot",
        width: 2048 / 2,
        height: 1365 / 2,
        className: "rotate-[2deg]",
      },
      {
        src: "/images/robert-roots-2.jpg",
        alt: "robert root rot",
        width: 2048 / 2,
        height: 1365 / 2,
        className: "rotate-[-3deg]",
      },
    ]}
  />

2. **He was getting a little too chilly**  
   Sitting beside a big window during the Canadian winter is less than ideal, to say the least. Surprisingly, they also do not like direct sunlight, as it can dehydrate them and even sunburn their leaves. Instead, orchids thrive in warm, indirect light.

3. **Orchids just want to relax**  
   I think I have been moving him around too much. 'Im no plantologist, but being constantly shaken, tapped, slammed, and spun is _probably_ not conducive to healthy growth. I imagine this is stressing him out, so it is no surprise that he is balding...
