Oh hi.

I'm not sure what this is going to be quite yet.

I've spent way too long trying to come up with a website design that I like, but I'm realizing that I will never be perfectly content with whatever I concoct. I want to create a place for me to harbour my thoughts, mainly for myself, but also for the stray travelers who are graced by Google's SEO.

Here are a couple of things that I want to write about:

- [ ] Saving my plant
- [ ] Skiing in Nelson
- [ ] Traveling around Europe

Beyond that, I have no clue what I'll put on here. Probably some movie reviews where I say words like _mise-en-sc√®ne_ to sound really pretentious. I also have some ideas about doing a post-mortem on my university classes, namely "The Music of Led Zeppelin" and "Compiler Construction", but I'll probably be too burnt out once the semester is over.

<sup>ok thats everything bye</sup>
