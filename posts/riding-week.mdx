Today is February 18th, a long awaited date for me and 7 of my friends. By some miracle, we actually managed to successfully (well, hopefully successfully) plan a group trip together to Nelson during the reading week. The last hill I went to along the powder highway was Revelstoke, and that was an unforgettable experience so my expectations are perhaps a little bit too high, but any skiing is better than no skiing.
