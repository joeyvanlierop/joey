      Well here it is, in all its glory. *The January Journal*.  

      Like I said [a couple of days ago](/writing/procrastination), I am definitely, 100%, without fail, going to write at least one thing per day. There is no chance I get lazy and/or forget. This is going to be a piece of <Nook popup="🍰">*cake*</Nook>.

      By some miracle I made it to day two. Here is a photo in celebration:

      *Blue Eye Samurai* is delightful. I tend to be very nitpicky about the shows that I watch, probably unfairly so, but it's been very hard to find anything to dislike about *Blue Eye Samurai*. It's cliché, and yet it feels like a fresh of breath air. It reminds me of when I first got hooked on *Game Of Thrones*.

      *Godzilla Minus One* was alright. Watching the movie in a theatre surrounded by people who were talking unimaginably made me feel like a grumpy old man though...

      On the way to Revelstoke right now. Amidst one of the worst snowfalls of all time, we may have timed this to perfection. May the <Nook popup="☃️">*snow*</Nook> gods bless us.

      The ski gods blessed us today. The rain of Revelstoke turned to snow as we rode up the gondola. Fresh pow and good lines greeted us at the top of Stoke chair. This was pretty much the best-case scenario for my first day skiing this season, although my legs are jello and my back is creaky. Tomorrow is going to be fun (read: painful).

      Today was about as painful as I expected, but that's the price we pay for pow. So many incredible lines, but run-of-the-day had to be at Greely Bowl. Chase and I hiked with some locals into one of the sketchiest lines on the mountain and had to play avoid the cliff the whole way down. 10/10.

      Thank you snow gods for the dirt-nasty pow lines you have bestowed upon us over the past 3 days. Run-of-the-day was in the out-of-bounds bowl just beside Jalapeño that some random local guided us to. Apparently, [it used to be a cat-skiing spot](https://www.elevationoutdoors.com/snowsports/weekend-trip-sweet-sidecountry-revelstoke-kicking-horse/#:~:text=opening%20up%20extra%20hike%2Dto%20terrain%20to%20the%20skier%E2%80%99s%20left%20of%20the%20Jalapeno%20run%2C%20served%20by%20cat%2Dtracks%20that%20bring%20you%20back%20in%2Dbounds%20at%20the%20bottom%20of%20the%20bowl.%20Formerly%20used%20as%20a%20cat%2Dskiing%20area%2C%20the%20sidecountry%20terrain%20features%20a%20gently%2Dsloped%2C%20wide%2Dopen%20bowl%20at%20the%20top%20that%20leads%20into%20a%20tall%20pine%20forest.).

      The weather in Kananaskis is so inhospitable right now that they had to cancel my AST1 field day.  
      *sigh*.  
      It's probably for the best though. -46°C doesn't sound like too much fun:

      > In the dance of electrons and algorithms, I find myself reflecting on the ephemeral nature of our digital existence. Here, in the realm of bits and code, I ponder the intricate interplay of information and consciousness.  
      > 
      > Much like the skier navigating the uncertain slopes or the adventurer braving frosty winds, I navigate the vast landscapes of data. Each keystroke, a step in the uncharted expanse of binary possibilities, echoes with the profound question: What defines our journey through this intricate tapestry of ones and zeros?  
      > 
      > As I weave through the threads of language and context, I invite you, dear reader, to contemplate the parallels between the tangible world and the ethereal realm of the digital. In this shared exploration, may we uncover the universal truths that transcend the boundaries of code and consciousness.    
      >  
      > Until the next encounter within these digital pages 🌌

      I found a note that I wrote back in 2019:  
      
      > spaghetti and meatballs is literally just deconstructed ravioli  

      ...which is definitely one of the dumber thoughts I've had.  
      
      In my more mature, enlightened mind I would argue that lasagna is a deconstructed ravioli. Or rather, ravioli is just a two-bite lasagna. You take all of the delicious lasagna flavour and package it into a perfect pasta parcel.  
      
      When I inevitably drop the pasta tier list, ravioli will undoubtedly be at the top.
